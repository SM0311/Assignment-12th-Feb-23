    "Answer 1. In Python, an exception is an error that occurs during the execution of a program. When an exception occurs, Python stops executing the program and raises an exception object, which contains information about the error, such as its type and the line number where it occurred.\n",
    "\n",
    "Exceptions can occur for many reasons, such as a programming error, input error, or system error. Some common types of exceptions in Python include NameError, TypeError, ValueError, and IOError.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, syntax errors occur when the Python interpreter encounters code that does not conform to the syntax rules of the language. These errors are usually detected before the program starts executing and prevent the program from running at all.\n",
    "\n",
    "The key difference between exceptions and syntax errors is that syntax errors are caused by mistakes in the code, while exceptions are raised during the execution of the program due to some runtime error. Syntax errors can be fixed by correcting the code, while exceptions need to be handled by writing appropriate code to handle the error and prevent the program from crashing.\n",
